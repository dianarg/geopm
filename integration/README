GEOPM INTEGRATION SCRIPTS
-------------------------

Welcome to GEOPM integration.

For performance experiment scripts, see experiment/README

For integration tests, see test/README

For application-specific configurations, see apps/README


---------------------------
This directory contains scripts for running GEOPM for performance and
integration testing.  Refer to the README files in each subdirectory
for more information.

The structure is organized as follows:

- Any python scripts in this directory are utilities used by both
  tests and experiments.

- apps: scripts that encapsulate the required setup, run
        configuration, and command line arguments for applications.

- experiment: scripts to help run experiments and analyze the output
              in a consistent way, regardless of the application

- test: integration tests of the GEOPM runtime.  These tests may use
        functions from the experiment scripts to assist in launch and
        analyze, but they also perform assertions on the results.
